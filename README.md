# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to Siteglide's Documentation! Siteglide allows developers to take control over code and data via API, CLI or UI. With the right blend of out-of-the-box tools and freedom to develop - without limits.

Most Topics will include the following types of articles:

* Introduction - a brief overview of the topic, how it fits into the broader Siteglide ecosystem and some use-cases in which it might be worth incorporating into your sites
* Reference - a brief reference guide to this feature for developers and anyone intersted in code
* File Structure - If this feature involves code, the file structure will show you which folders and files are necessary and where to add them to your codebase. This will be presented in the format from which you would see it in Siteglide CLI; if you're using the code-editor in the Siteglide Admin, the structure will be very similar but will skip the first few folders in the structure and normally start with layouts.
* &#x20;Step by Step Articles - How to Implement a Feature or Solve a Problem
* CLI - Advice and tips for using CLI relevant to this feature
* SiteBuilder - Advice and tips using SiteBuilder to create ready-to-go layouts for this feature
* Migration - Advice and tips for migrating data of this type into Siteglide
