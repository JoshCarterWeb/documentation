Email Templates must be stored within the following file path of your project: `marketplace_builder/notifications/email_notifications/forms/form_1/` - replace "form\_1" with the relevant form ID. The autoresponder template file must be called `autoresponder.liquid`. The workflow template file must be called workflow\.liquid.

## Example

This is an example email autoresponder/workflow file generated by Siteglide. Below, we'll list available YML parameters, and body content.

```yaml
---
delay: '0'
enabled: true
from: demo_kit <demo_kit@siteglide.com>
layout_path: ''
physical_file_path: notifications/email_notifications/forms/form_1/autoresponder.liquid
reply_to: demo_kit <demo_kit@siteglide.com>
subject: Thanks for getting in touch
to: '{{ form.properties.email }}'
trigger_condition: t
---
<!--EMAIL CONTENT HERE -->
```

## Parameters

`physical_file_path`  - Files should be stored in a location relative to their form ID. If your ID is '3', and you're editing an Autoresponder, then the physical\_file\_path would be notifications/email\_notifications/forms/form\_3/autoresponder.liquid

Other fields will show in Siteglide UI when editing a form (subject, from, reply\_to). There's nothing else going on here from the perspective of requirements to manage your notifications in Siteglide. You may want to check out the platformOS documentation: <https://documentation.platform-os.com/tutorials/notifications/creating-email-notification>

Body - You can access form data via `{{form.properties}}`.

Custom fields are accessible via `{{form.properties.form_field_1_2}}`

where 1 = form ID and 2 = field ID.
