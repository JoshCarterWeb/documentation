This is a brief overview of the GraphQL tutorials we currently provide and the topics we plan to cover in future.

# Introduction

This Article aims to give an overview of the topics currently covered in our GraphQL tutorials, and the topics we aim to provide in the future.

For a longer introduction to GraphQL and how it can be used with Siteglide, check out the following Article:** **[About GraphQL](https://developers.siteglide.com/about-graphql)

# How the Tutorials Work

These GraphQL tutorials are organised by topic, but we'd recommend you work through them one by one.&#x20;

This is because each tutorial will build upon the skills covered in previous ones. 

We also include challenges- because when learning something like GraphQL it always helps to get hands-on experience exploring and applying the skills you've picked up. Don't worry if you can't quite manage the challenges straight away. Give them your best shot and then check the answer pages.
