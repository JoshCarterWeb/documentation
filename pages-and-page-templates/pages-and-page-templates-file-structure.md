# ðŸŒ³ Pages and Page Templates File Structure

All Liquid files live somewhere inside the views folder.

Since Page Templates are called Layouts in platformOS, this is their name in the file structure.&#x20;

Page Templates (Layouts) in a Siteglide site should be stored in a templates sub-folder and named by their unique ID in Siteglide.&#x20;
