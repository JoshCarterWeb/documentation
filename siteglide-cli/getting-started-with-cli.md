# üçÉ Getting Started with CLI

## Dependencies

The CLI is distributed via Node Package Manager (NPM) and so you will need NodeJS installed on your machine. The easiest way to get this is to visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version as this has better support.

Siteglide CLI requires a minimum of NodeJS version 10

## Installing & Updating

You can use the following to install Siteglide CLI.

`npm i -g @siteglide/siteglide-cli`

When an update is released for the CLI, you can use the same command as above to install the updated version. Please note that the flags for commands below are not available on all versions of the CLI, updating to the latest version will allow you to use all of them.

### Installing on Mac

The following video will give you a complete walkthrough guide for setting up Siteglide CLI on a Mac. Feel free to skip ahead to the parts you find the most useful.

The steps I follow in the video can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory). If you are using zsh as your shell then the commands here will have to be run against the `~/.zshrc` file, not `~/.profile`. ZSH is the default for Macs since macOS Catalina, to find out which shell you are using you can run `echo ${SHELL}` in terminal. If the `~/.profile` or `~/.zshrc` files do not already exist then you may need to create them first before running the export PATH command
